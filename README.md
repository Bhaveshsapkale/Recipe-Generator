🧠 What I Learned

How environment variables work in Vite

Difference between frontend vs backend deployments

Handling API keys safely

Debugging deployment issues (the hard way 😭)

Git & GitHub best practices

⚠️ Limitations

API key is exposed in frontend (not production-safe)

Rate limits depend on OpenAI usage

Backend version recommended for real-world use

📌 Future Improvements

Move AI logic to backend

Add user authentication
